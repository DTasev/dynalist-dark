# VERSION 1.3 Bug fixes and Changes
- Internal link text is now properly centered.
- Completed internal link, normal link or a tag now gray out and have ~~strike through~~ formatting.
- Multi line links now look better.
- Improving the multi line links also makes links in titles look better, dynalist internal links still look bad in title but that's a Dynalist issue.

# VERSION 1.2 Changes
- Fixed internal Dynalist links having the symbol in front
- Fixed long internal links not collapsing down to (...)
- Fixed image having the symbol in front
- Background is now darker to make out the indent '|' lines

IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, please feel free to leave them in the [comments below](https://userstyles.org/styles/131191/dynalist-dark-v1-2), but I cannot promise anything in regards to when or if they will be implemented.

Tested only on Windows, Chrome Version 51.0.2704.103 m (64-bit).
